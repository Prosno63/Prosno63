## About Me

👋 Hello, I'm a BSc Computer Science student who's passionate about coding and learning. My journey into the world of software development started with a simple curiosity, and I've been on an exciting adventure ever since.

📚 As a student, I've had the opportunity to work on various academic projects that have honed my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of computer science concepts. These projects have given me a solid foundation to build upon.

🚀 In addition to my academic work, I'm a dedicated self-learner. I've explored a range of technologies, from building responsive front-ends with HTML, CSS, and React.js to crafting powerful back-end solutions with Node.js, Firebase, and MongoDB. I've also embraced the versatility of the Tailwind CSS framework and the magic of JavaScript.

🔧 Here's a snapshot of my skills:

  🌐 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for creating web interfaces.
 
  ⚛️ React.js for building interactive and user-friendly applications.
 
  🌿 Node.js for server-side development and APIs.
 
  🔥 Firebase for real-time databases and authentication.
 
  🍃 MongoDB for flexible data storage.
 
  🎨 Tailwind CSS framework for crafting sleek designs.



🌱 I'm continually seeking new challenges and learning opportunities to push my skills further.
